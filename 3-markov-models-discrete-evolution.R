# 3: Markov models of discrete character evolution

# we are interested in producing MLEs for the following two parameters: q01 = transition rate from state 0 to state 1, and q10 = transition rate from state 1 to state 0

# simulate a binary trait (state 0 and state 1) on a birth-death tree
set.seed(2)
phy <- tree.bd(c(.1, .03), max.taxa=50)
plot(phy)

# simulate the binary trait where rate of evolution from state 0 to state 1 within a lineage is 0.1, and 0.2 for state 1 to state 0. Start the tree in state 0 (x0=0). Use a Mk2 model of character evolution
set.seed(1)
states <- sim.character(phy, c(.1, .2), x0=0, model="mk2")

# remember: because the tree is simulated, we know the true values of the parameters q01=0.1 and q10=0.2

# build a likelihood function based on Mk2 model (used to find likelihood of parameter values: probability of the observed distribution of character states given that the tree evolved according to a given model of character evolution and/or diversification)
lik.mk2 <- make.mk2(phy, states)

# run ML analysis using an initial parameter guess of (0.1, 0.1)
# I tried with initial guesses ranging from (0.1, 0.9) to (0.9, 0.1) and similar MLEs are produced in each case
fit.mk2 <- find.mle(lik.mk2, c(.1, .1), method="subplex")

# parameter estimates for q01 and q10 from the fit
coef(fit.mk2)
# q01        q10 
# 0.08399429 0.23020744 
# difference is slightly larger than the true model parameters (0.1 and 0.2)

# compare our Markov model fit to a null hypothesis model (with parameters q01 = q10) to test if the Mk fit is statistically justified

# build likelihood function based on null model of q01 = q10
lik.mk1 <- constrain(lik.mk2, q10 ~ q01) # q values constrained to be equal

# run ML analysis using intial guess of 0.1 again
fit.mk1 <- find.mle(lik.mk1, .1, method="subplex")
anova(fit.mk2, mk1=fit.mk1)
#      Df   lnLik    AIC    ChiSq   Pr(>|Chi|)   
# full  2  -26.522  57.044                     
# mk1   1  -31.095  64.191  9.1466   0.002492

# we can conclude that the asymmetric Markov model fits better; the rate of evolution from state 1 to state 0 is greater than that of state 0 to state 1
